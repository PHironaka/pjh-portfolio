  For the past few weeks, I've been working on finishing the MVP of my first
  Rails app. It's called Scoutmaster, and I built it for Producers specifically
  during the location scouting process.

I'm still in the process of pushing through updates but you can check it out here. It's been a fun and rewarding experience to build my first web app. In the spirit of always learning and getting better, I've listed out some of the top takeaways I take away from the process:

## 

## When in doubt, commit your code

This was a bigger issue at the start of the project for me. I'd be in the middle of writing some code and without saving it, I would revert back to what I had previously written. The beauty of using git is that you can always revert back to a previous commit. Don't be afraid to commit, is the moral of the story.



## The user comes first

I know, this all sounds incredibly redundant, you'll have to bear with me. As I started to add in more features, it started becoming apparent that I was over-cluttering the app to the point where it became difficult to find the essential elements I wanted the user to use. Part of figuring out what my MVP was stripping away any of the excess fat, or unnecessary features that weren't as relevant.



I'm still in the process of pushing a few final updates to achieve my MVP, but by all accounts this is how I envisioned the finished product to look like. I hope it serves my fellow producers well in the field!
