description: >-
  My new personal basketball project. Also my first Django app. Basketball Is
  Fun is a community built on the backboards of basketball courts. The less well
  known the courts are, the better. We're trying to uncover the diamond in the
  rough no one knows about. Gonna be tiiiiiiight.
